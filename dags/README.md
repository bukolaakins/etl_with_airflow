This project implements an ETL pipeline using Python, designed to extract data from a ClickHouse database, transform it, and load it into an SQLite database. 

Airflow is used to orchestrate the workflow. The pipeline extracts data from ClickHouse, transforms it, and loads the processed data into SQLite.
